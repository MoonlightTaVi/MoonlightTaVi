- 👋 Hi, I’m @MoonlightTaVi
- 👀 I’m interested in Natural Language Processing, Domain Specific Languages, Java and Godot (and a little bit of Unity) programming, making different types of 2/2.5D and text-based games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and LibGDX
- 💞️ I’m looking for any official work in any programming-related field, corresponding to my knowledges
- 📫 How to reach me: moonlight9512@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started programming as a self-learner at the age of 12, and I haven't received any education in programming at all
