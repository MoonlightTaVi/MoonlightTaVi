- 👋 Hi, I’m @MoonlightTaVi
- 👀 I’m interested in Natural Language Processing, Domain Specific Languages, Java and Godot (and a little bit of Unity) programming, making different types of 2/2.5D and text-based games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and LibGDX, at 2024.10 has started learning Java Spring (mainly databases) and Frontend stack (React). Also gonna study C++ for educational purposes
- 💞️ I’m looking for any official job in any programming-related field, corresponding to my knowledges, or participating in any interesting game project (2D or 2,5D, text-based, AI-powered, PC or Android)
