## Greetings
Name's **MoonlightTaVi**. Java enjoyer, C++ admirer. Always trying to find out something new. Making games since I was around ~12-14: the mere reason why I started programming. Like Java's phylosophy of "high and safe abstraction", but also like C's "do it yourself". Find some relaxation in working with Data Queries.

### P.S.
_Currently the profile is under heavy reconstruction; many repositories became private (because I don't like them), but I want to upload some new projects (based on the previous ones), which hopefully are going to have a solid ground beneath feet._
### Working on:
- A game engine (or, rather, _a facade_), based upon the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) framework; willing to take some interesting and unusual approaches towards the pipeline of game development (doing it rather for my interests; I don't like existing game engines)
- Some projects based on Java Spring, because while I know something about it, I have no real projects (except for one hidden) based upon it
